# WebAssembly System Interface

![WASI](WASI.png)

This repository is for the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) Subgroup of the
[WebAssembly Community Group]. Its [Charter] describes the goals, scope and
deliverables of the group. The repository may contain meeting notes, reports,
documentation, specifications and/or software produced by the group (although
larger projects may also have their own repositories).

We'll be adding more content here before long, but for now, check out these:
 - https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/ - Blog post introducing WASI
 - https://wasi.dev/ - Links to more information about WASI, including
   how to get started using it.
 - https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/issues - This repo's issue tracker

The issue tracker is the place to ask questions, make suggestions, and start
discussions.

As a W3C CG Subgroup, we'll also be having [meetings](meetings/README.md).
A tentative agenda for the first meeting is [here](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/master/meetings/2019/WASI-liftoff.md).
Once we have a date and time, we'll post that here also.
