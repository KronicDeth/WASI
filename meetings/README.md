# WASI meetings

Meetings of the WASI Subgroup of the W3C WebAssembly Community Group (CG) follow
[the process of the CG](https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings).

We're currently working on setting up the first WASI video-conference, which we
expect will use the zoom.us service that the CG uses. Once a date is set up,
we'll post details an agenda here.
